### Use them in Thunderbird
Let's goo! First step. Hit settings. Then hit Account Settings. Then click your account. Then click Attach the signature from a file instead (text, HTML, or image), and upload the HTML file. It really is that easy!

#### About the images
Gmail really doesn't like SVGs (they don't load), so we have to use PNG. Yes I am using this repo to host the images.
